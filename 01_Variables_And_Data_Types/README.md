# Practice 01: Variables and Data Types

This script, related to "Day 6" of my Python learning journey, demonstrates the use of various fundamental data types.

## The Task:

1.  **Declare and Initialize:**
    * Create an **integer** variable named `apples_count` and assign the number `15` to it.
    * Create a **float** variable named `item_price` and assign the value `24.99` to it.
    * Create a **string** variable named `product_name` and assign the text `"Laptop Charger"` to it.
    * Create a **boolean** variable named `is_available` and assign `True` to it.
    * Create a **list** variable named `shopping_list` and assign at least three items (as strings) to it.
    * Create a **tuple** variable named `rgb_color` and assign three numerical values to it.
    * Create a **dictionary** variable named `user_profile` with keys `'username'`, `'email'`, and `'is_active'`, and assign appropriate values.

2.  **Print Values and Types:**
    * For each variable, print its value and its data type using the `type()` function.
