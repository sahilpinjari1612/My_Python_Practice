# Practice 02: String Slicing and Operations

This script, related to "Day 12" of my Python learning journey, demonstrates fundamental string manipulation techniques.

## The Task:

1.  **Define a String:**
    * Create a string variable named `sentence` with the value `"Python is a powerful language."`.

2.  **String Slicing:**
    * Extract the word "Python" and store it in a variable `word_1`.
    * Extract the word "powerful" and store it in a variable `word_2`.
    * Extract the word "language." using negative indexing and store it in a variable `word_3`.
    * Reverse the entire `sentence` string and store it in a variable `reversed_sentence`.

3.  **String Operations:**
    * Find and print the total length of the `sentence` string.
    * Concatenate `word_1`, `" is a "`, `word_2`, and `" tool."` to form a new sentence and store it.
    * Print the `word_1` string repeated 3 times.

4.  **Print Results:**
    * Print all the new variables and operation results with clear labels.
