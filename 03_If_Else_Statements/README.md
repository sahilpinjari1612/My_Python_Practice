# Practice 03: If-Else Conditional Statements

This script, related to "Day 14" of my Python learning journey, demonstrates the use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

## The Task:

Write a script that determines a user's eligibility for a movie based on their age.

1.  **Take User Input:**
    * Ask the user for their age and store it as an integer in a variable named `age`.

2.  **Implement `if-else` Logic:**
    * **If `age` is 18 or older:** Print a message saying `"You are old enough to watch the movie."`.
    * **If `age` is exactly 17:** Use an `elif` statement to print `"You are almost old enough! Come back next year."`.
    * **For all other ages:** Use an `else` statement to print `"You are not old enough to watch the movie."`.
