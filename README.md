# My Python Learning Journey üêç

This repository documents my progress and practice exercises while learning Python. It contains code for various topics, organized day by day, to solidify my understanding of the language.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a practice session covering a specific topic. The folder names are numbered to show the sequence of my learning.

- **`01_Variables_And_Data_Types/`**: Practice with fundamental data types like strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries.
- **`02_String_Slicing_And_Operations/`**: Exercises on manipulating strings, including slicing, concatenation, and more.
- **`03_If_Else_Statements/`**: Code demonstrating conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- **`04_Match_Case_Statements/`**: Practice with modern `match-case` statements for cleaner conditional checks.

*(Note: Add new entries here as you complete more practice sessions.)*
